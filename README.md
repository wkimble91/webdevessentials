## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicons.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Components.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ card-content.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.png
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.webp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layouts.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Pages.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ externalscript.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ externalscript.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ style.scss
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components go.

`src/content/` is where any markdown files go and they are automatically populated as individual cards.

Any static assets, like images and favicons, can either be placed in the `public/` directory or the 'src/images' directory.

Style files, including Scss, can be directly imported without compiling beforehand. Scss can also be written directly to Astro files.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
